                    <p>Christianity remains the world's largest religion, and the Bible the world's best selling book. We believe that in Jesus Christ, God was made man and taught his followers about belief, values and the meaning of life.</p>

                    <p>Jesus Christ lived in what is now the Middle East and was executed by being nailed to a cross in about 30AD. He was in his early thirties when he died. Jesus was put on trial for speaking out about his beliefs and criticising the values of his society. He was sentenced to death and was crucified. To the amazement of his followers, who watched him die, three days later Jesus was raised from the dead.
                    </p>


                    <p>This experience transformed the lives of a group of very ordinary men and women. They had witnessed evil overwhelmed by good. Christianity had begun. We believe that the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is God's guarantee that he cares for us forever.</p>

                    


                        <p>We believe that the teachings of Jesus during his lifetime show us the way in which we should live. We aspire to follow these teachings in our daily lives and to apply them.</p>

                    </div>
                <div class="">
                    <p>We know that no-one is perfect and that everyone make mistakes. We all do. But we believe God forgives us when we say sorry to him as we try to learn from what we have done wrong.</p>

                    <p>We don't have all the answers. Only God does. By entering into a relationship with God, through the teachings of Jesus, we look to serve him better with the life he has given us. Life itself now has a new meaning. No failure or disaster can be beyond recovery.</p>
                    <p>Once a person has accepted that God cares for them, they look at other people in a new way - for God is equally concerned for each of us. Prayer - talking to and listening to God - is also for everyone, but it takes time and practice.</p>
                    <p>All the important things in life - work, sex, money, relationships - are of concern to God. Human beings are trusted by God to be generous with their lives. After death we shall account to God for the way we have lived.</p>
