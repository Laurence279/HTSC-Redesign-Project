                        <p>Wherever and whenever you choose to get married, you make a public declaration of life-long commitment to love each other faithfully and take on a whole new legal status as husband and wife.</p>
                        <p>It is a considerable commitment to make. Whether you choose to marry in a civil venue, or in a religious context of any faith, around 85% of married couples agree: marriage is the most serious decision of your life!</p>
                        <h4>“We couldn’t be more committed now that we are married. There is nothing else beyond marriage to make us more committed.”</h4>
                        <p>The Church thoroughly believes in marriage for the wellbeing of individuals and society. If you have found ‘the one’, and you are committed to each other in every respect, there is so much more adventure ahead. We would be thrilled to be part of that adventure too.</p>
                        <p>You are welcome to church for the wedding of your dreams - and if you have children we welcome them too. Marriage and Thanksgiving for the Gift of a Child is ideal if you wish to celebrate your wedding and thank God for the birth of your children on the same occasion.</p>
                        <p>Did you know that we can also offer a service of prayer and dedication after a civil wedding or arrange special services for anniversaries and renewal of wedding vows whether you were married in a church or not?</p>
                        <p>For more information please call or email:</p>

                        <p>Everyone is welcome to have their children christened (baptised) in their parish church - in fact there's no age limit!. During the Christening service your baby will be baptised. There are around 10,000 babies and children baptised in the Church of England every month. Baptism isn't just for children - you are never too old to be baptised. Your child is precious to you and precious to God. At Baptism you make a decision to start your child on a journey of faith. The church and the godparents support the family and the child in this decision.</p>
                        <h4>“Everyone is welcome to have their children christened in their parish church.”</h4>
                        <p>Some parents might want to celebrate the gift of a child in a different way without the commitment that baptism involves. During the Thanksgiving service parents and families give thanks for the birth or adoption of a child and everyone prays for family life. It can take place in church with the congregation, or with just family and friends gathered, or elsewhere such as home, or even in hospital.</p>
                        <p>A Thanksgiving Service is not a Baptism. There are no promises to make about the Christian faith. The child will be blessed and prayed for, and supporting friends will promise to support the parents in bringing up their baby.</p>
                        <p>To find out more about a Baptism or Thanksgiving Service please call or email:</p>
